   - Classes for helping to publish consistent diagnostics (each topic
   will publish certain diagnostics, each driver will publish certain
   diagnostics, etc.), and to make diagnostics less tedious to write.
 
   - Classes for helping to run self-tests and publish their results.

   - A dynamic reconfiguration system to allow driver parameters to be
   changed without taking down the driver, and to autogenerate parameter
   documentation.

   - A base class for sensors to provide a consistent state machine
   (retries, error handling, etc.) and interface.
