<p>
sound_play provides a ROS node that translates commands on a ROS topic (<tt>robotsound</tt>) into sounds. The node supports built-in sounds, playing OGG/WAV files, and doing speech synthesis via festival. C++ and Python bindings allow this node to be used without understanding the details of the message format, allowing faster development and resilience to message format changes.
</p>
<p>
This node has been tested on the Logitech USB speakers on the PR2 and on some built-in intel sound-cards, but should support any sound card that is supported by SDL. Because it accesses SDL via pygame, it has no control over which sound device is used. You will have to configure SDL and ALSA/OSS to default to the sound device you want to use.
