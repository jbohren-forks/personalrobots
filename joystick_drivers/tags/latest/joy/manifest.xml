  <description brief="Monitors a joystick and sends its state">
  This package contains two nodes. The oldest is "joy", maintained only for
  backwards compatibility. New code and launch files should use "txjoy", which
  follows the current (0.6) ROS API.

  The ps3_joy node uses the PS3 SIXAXIS joystick. This node is very similar to the txjoy node, but the PS3 joystick uses a different default range for its axes. All PS3 joysticks must use this node.
