    amcl is a probabilistic localization system for a robot moving in
    2D. It implements the adaptive (or KLD-sampling) Monte Carlo
    localization approach (as described by Dieter Fox), which uses a
    particle filter to track the pose of a robot against a known map.

    'amcl' Player driver.
